# RTA-TCN-and-JITL-RTA-TCN
A Temporal Convolution Network-Based Just-in-Time Learning Method for Industrial Quality Variable Prediction

The files JITL-RTA-TCN-DC.py and JITL-RTA-TCN-SRU.py implement a just-in-time learning method, while RTA-TCN-DC.py and RTA-TCN-SRU.py utilize the RTA-TCN method. The datasets are provided in Debutanizer_data.txt and SRU_data.txt. Specifically, Debutanizer_data.txt is used by both JITL-RTA-TCN-DC.py and RTA-TCN-DC.py, whereas SRU_data.txt is used by JITL-RTA-TCN-SRU.py and RTA-TCN-SRU.py.
